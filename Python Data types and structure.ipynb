It allows for fastllookups, insertion, and deletion due to its internal implementation using hasing table.\n","\n","5: Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?\n","  - List:-\n","    - It allows duplication\n","    - The order can be maintained\n","    - Modificattion can be done\n","  - Set:\n","    - It stores only unique value\n","    - It stores as a unordered collection\n","    - Hash table lookup\n","  \n","6:  What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?\n","  - String:\n","    - Contains only characters\n","    - Requires creating a new string\n","    - Support indexing and slicing\n","  - List:\n","    - Can contain any data type\n","    - Can modify element in place\n","    - Support indexing and slicing\n","\n","7: How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?\n","  - Tuples are immutable sequence of element that means when it was created it cannot be changed.\n","    - Immutablity prevents accidental changes\n","    - Tuples are hasable\n","    - Memory efficiency and perfromance\n","    - Tuples Prevent Unintended Side Effects in Functions\n","\n","8: What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n","  - A hash-table in data structure that stores key value pairs and allows for the fast data retrival.\n","  - In python a dictonary is implemented using hash table.This provide fast lookup, insertion, and deletion.\n","\n","9: Can lists contain different data types in Python?\n","  - Python, list are hetrogenous, meaning they can store multiple data types within the same list.\n","  Ex: Integer, Tuple, String, float and dictionary.\n","\n","10: Explain why strings are immutable in Python?\n","  - A string in python is immutable, menaing it cannot be changed after creation. If you try to change part of a string. Python will raise TypeError.\n","\n","11: What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?\n","  - Advantages of dictionary over list are:\n","    - Fast lookup and keys\n","      - Dictionary allows for constant lookup because they are implemented using hash table.\n","    - Key value pair storage:\n","      - List are more suitable when you only need to store the sequence of values and they don't support direct association with values.\n","    - Flexiable and efficient data modification:\n","      - Dictionaries allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and updates for keys.\n","    - No duplicates for keys:\n","      - Lists allows duplicates, which may cause errors in certain situations.\n","\n","\n","12: Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list?\n","  - Tuples are preferable over list, Tuples are immutable are best used when you need to ensure data integrity, efficiency and constant value.\n","\n","13:  How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?\n","  - Sets are the collection of unique elements. This means that they automatically discard any duplicat values when elements are added.\n","\n","14: How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?\n","  - IN with lists:\n","    - When using IN with the list. Python checks if the element exists in the list.\n","  - IN with dictionaries:\n","    - When using IN with dictionary. Python checks if a key exists in the dictionary.\n","\n","15: Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not?\n","  - No, you can't modify the element of a tuple once it has been created.This is because tuple are immutable in python meaning you cant edit after creation.\n","  Tuple are designed immutable because of several reasons:\n","    - Data integrity and security\n","    - Performance optimization\n","    - Hashability\n","\n","16: What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case?\n","  - A nested dictionary is a directory that contains another dictionary as a value inside it.This allows you to store data in a hierarchical format.\n","  UseCase: Managing construction project data:\n","    - A civil engineering firm might need to manage multiple construction projects, each with various attributes like location, budget, and assigned engineers.\n","\n","17: Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary?\n","  - Dictionaries in python are implemented using hash tables, making element high efficiently.\n","    - Average case 0(1) Complex Time\n","    - Worst case 0(n) Linear Time\n","\n","18: In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?\n","  - While dictionaries are great for quick lookup for keys, list are prefered in situations where ordered,sequential and indexed-based access is required.\n","    - Maintaining order:\n","      - List contain the order of element, making them ideal for ordered collections.\n","    - Iteration and Indexed access:\n","      - Lists allow fast, indexed access using integer positions making them more efficient when position-based retrieval is needed.\n","\n","19: Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?\n","  - Dictionaries in python version before 3.7 were considered unordered because they contain the key value pairs using a hash value, which doesn't maintain the insertion order.\n","  - Fast key based lookups:-\n","    - Instead of searching through elements sequently like list, dictionary uses hash function to directly located a key in constant time.\n","  - No Index-Based Access:\n","    - Unlike list, you cannot retrive items by position.\n","\n","20: Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval?\n","  - List Data retrieval:\n","    - The data position was access through Index\n","    - The lookup speed known through 0(1)\n","    - Order preservation maintains insertion order\n","    - It allowes the duplicate values\n","  - Dictionary Data retrieval:\n","    - The data position was access through key value\n","    - The lookup speed known through on average 0(1)\n","    - Order preservation maintain insertion order\n","    - It doesn't allowed the duplicate value\n","
